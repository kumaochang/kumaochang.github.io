## About Me
I am Mao-Chang Ku, a Ph.D. student at the Graduate Institute of Linguistics, National Taiwan University. My work sits at the intersection of computational and corpus linguistics, syntax, and the documentation of Formosan languages.

## Research Focus
- Corpus construction of indigenous Formosan languages in Taiwan
- Speech and language technology that supports endangered language revitalization
- Use of large language models (LLMs) for linguistic research
- Tooling for linguists, from annotation interfaces to lightweight agentic pipelines

## Beyond Research
Outside the lab, I enjoy playing Mahjong and a variety of role-playing games like **Pokémon**—and I rarely travel without a stack of novels. My reading queue rotates between wuxia epics, mystery procedurals, and sweeping fantasy series.
