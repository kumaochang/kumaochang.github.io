My research focuses on how computational methods can be applied to Indigenous Formosan languages in Taiwan. Selected works are grouped below for quick reference.

## Journal Articles
1. **A Corpus-based Study of Causative Constructions in Paiwan.** With Milingan Chia-hao Tai and Shu-Kai Hsieh. *Foreign Language Studies, 41* (2025), 1–33. Demonstrates how a statistical method and balanced corpora explain the productivity of Paiwan causatives.
2. **Empowering Elementary Learning: Utilizing Large Language Models to Craft Tailored Textbooks with Expert Insight.** With Da-Chen Lian, Po-Ya Angela Wang, Wei-Ling Chen, and Shu-Kai Hsieh. *Journal of Library and Information Studies, 23*(2), 145-183. Outlines an expert-in-the-loop pipeline for trustworthy textbook customization.

## Conference Papers & Posters
